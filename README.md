# TEMPORAL_EMBMON
Temporal runtime monitor for Embedded systems, and event monitoring.


P Thirumeni CSIR-NAL

Use MLTL formulas for recurruing time event monitoring. (the monitor recursively continues to monitor the APs from time reference 'NOW')

Use MLTL_ABS for absolute time event monitoring. (the monitor evaluated the APs for the given absolute time 'slice' with the 
time reference starting from t0=start time of the mission.

By combining both these time zones the evaluations can be made for any real world temporal events, patterns and sequences.
